### Phase 10: Desktop Integration, DSP Audio & Future Roadmap

- [ ] Linux MPRIS2 D-Bus Interface: Implement `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2` and `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player` for native media controls, lock screen metadata, and hotkey integration
- [ ] Multi-Band DSP Equalizer: Implement interactive 6-band audio equalizer (60Hz, 150Hz, 400Hz, 1kHz, 2.4kHz, 15kHz) with biquad peaking/shelving filters and genre presets (Flat, Bass Boost, Vocal, Rock, Electronic)

- [ ] Global Media Key Bindings: Global media keys listener on Windows (`MediaSession`), macOS (`MPRemoteCommandCenter`), and Linux

## Architectural Debt

- [ ] Floating-point precision in disk roundtrip serialization: JSON float serialization (`0.65`) deserializes into `f32` with tiny epsilon deviations; assert with delta tolerance (`0.001`) instead of `f32::EPSILON`.
- [ ] Memory profiling harness on Linux: set up automated RSS tracking with `heaptrack` or `valgrind --tool=massif` to guarantee the < 25 MB ceiling under long-running playback.
- [ ] Bounded channel capacity tuning: monitor high-bitrate (320kbps) audio decoding backpressure against rodio sink buffer consumption under low-spec CPU constraints.

## Blocked / Needs Human Decision

- [ ] Decision on D-Bus / MPRIS2 crate dependency: select between lightweight raw D-Bus connection or `zbus` crate for Linux desktop media player integration.
- [ ] Decision on System Tray crate dependency: select between `tray-icon` (cross-platform, Tauri-maintained) or minimal platform-native hooks for system tray integration.
